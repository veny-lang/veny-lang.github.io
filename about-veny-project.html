  <h1>About the Veny Language Project</h1>
  <p><strong>Veny</strong> is an open source programming language built on long-standing experience working with object-oriented systems and real-world domain modeling. It was created by <strong>Stoyan Petkov</strong> to promote a practical, object-oriented approach to software design.</p>

  <p>The language emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and expressiveness in representing domain logic, especially in applications where understanding and maintaining the model is essential.</p>

  <h2>🚧 Work in Progress</h2>
  <p>
    Veny is currently in early development. The core compiler, language specification, and supporting tools are actively evolving.
    Project structure, contributor guidelines, and community governance are still being defined.
  </p>
