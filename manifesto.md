# The Veny Manifesto: Building Meaningful Software through Object-Oriented Design

> *“The greatest value in software is not in the code—it’s in the understanding the code represents.”*

## 1. Software Should Model the Real World

At the heart of every successful application lies a well-understood domain. But in modern practice, this domain is often buried under procedural code, disconnected services, and anemic data models.

**Veny exists to reverse that trend.**

It is a language built to express the *essence* of the problem being solved—through rich, behavior-driven, object-oriented modeling.

## 2. Object-Orientation Is Not a Style—It’s a Method of Thought

Veny doesn’t treat OO as an optional paradigm. It treats it as **the core tool for modeling complexity**, capturing relationships, enforcing boundaries, and co-locating data with behavior in the most natural and communicative way possible.

- **Classes** express identity  
- **Encapsulation** protects integrity  
- **Polymorphism** allows flexibility  
- **Composition** structures meaning  

## 3. Clean Code Starts with a Clear Model

We’ve all seen codebases that function but cannot evolve—because they don’t reflect the business they serve. Veny encourages developers to make the domain model the *center* of their applications.

This leads to code that is:
- Easier to explain  
- Easier to test  
- Easier to change  

Because it reflects the **real world**, not just the machine.

## 4. Designed for Real Applications, Not Toy Problems

Veny is not just for teaching—it is built to be used.

With strong typing, modern syntax, and Java platform integration (via GraalVM), Veny is ready for real work:
- Enterprise applications  
- Domain-driven design  
- Microservices  
- Tooling and platforms  

It brings **clarity and elegance** back into systems architecture.

## 5. Code That Communicates

Code is a human artifact. It lives longer than we think. It must communicate ideas, not just perform actions.

**Veny helps you speak clearly in code**  
So that others—including future you—understand what it means, not just what it does.

## A Call to Rediscover OO

Object-oriented programming is not obsolete—it’s misunderstood.

Veny invites you to rediscover its power. To return to clarity, discipline, and elegance in software design. And to build systems that grow with your understanding, not against it.
