# About the Veny Language Project

**Veny** is an open source programming language designed and developed by **Stoyan Petkov**, based on over 30 years of professional experience in software engineering and domain modeling.

The project is currently in an early, hands-on phase, with most of the focus on the compiler, core language design, and specification.

### ðŸš§ Work in Progress

Veny is still evolving. Project organization, contribution guidelines, governance, and community infrastructure are all works in progress.

The goal is to eventually grow Veny into a language supported by an open and welcoming community, with:
- Clear contributor processes
- Language roadmap and milestones
- Community discussions and feedback loops
- Tooling and platform support

If you're interested in contributing, sharing ideas, or just following the journey, feel free to star the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/veny-lang/language-spec), join the upcoming discussions, or reach out via [contact or social links].
