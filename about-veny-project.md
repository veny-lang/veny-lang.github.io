# About the Veny Language Project

**Veny** is an open source programming language built on long-standing experience working with object-oriented systems and real-world domain modeling. It was created by **Stoyan Petkov** to promote a practical, object-oriented approach to software design.

The language emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and expressiveness in representing domain logic, especially in applications where understanding and maintaining the model is essential.

### 🚧 Work in Progress

Veny is currently in early development. The core compiler, language specification, and supporting tools are actively evolving. Project structure, contributor guidelines, and community governance are still being defined.

### 🔗 Get Involved

If you're interested in object-oriented programming, language design, or domain modeling—and want to help shape the future of Veny—you’re welcome to follow the project or get in touch.
